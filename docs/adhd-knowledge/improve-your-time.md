# Improve your time

Start planning a day first, then a week. Choose one, get it done. Let ideas
flourish but triad committing to them. Underestimate the time it takes to do
something - call bullshit Subtract before you add. Bedtime target -
incrementally change. Artificial dawn device. Don't use bed for non-sleeping,
except for reading. Don't sleep on the couch.
